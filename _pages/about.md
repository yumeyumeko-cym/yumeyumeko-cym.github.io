About me..
======
I am currently the second-year graduate student at the University of Toronto and [Wireless Computing Lab](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/%7Eliang/group/WCL.html), where I am supervised by [Professor Ben Liang](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~liang/index.html).

I am passionate about developing machine learning frameworks for processing chronological data and designing reliable algorithms grounded in statistical principles. Feel free to reach out via my personal email or ymk.chen@mail.utoronto.ca.
